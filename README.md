## Features

### 1. **Advanced Environmental and Positional Sensing**
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**: Monitor worksite conditions to prevent heat stress and maintain comfort.
- **Gas Sensor**: Detect hazardous gas levels and provide immediate warnings.
- **Light Sensor**: Adjust for ambient light conditions to optimize visibility.
- **GPS Module**: Track worker location for safety and coordination.
- **Accelerometer and Gyroscope**: Detect falls, impacts, or irregular movements.

### 2. **Self-Healing Mesh Network**
- Employs **ESP32 microcontrollers** to create a robust and fault-tolerant network.
- Enables seamless communication between workersâ€™ helmets, ensuring consistent data flow.
- Automatically reroutes data in case of device failure, maintaining network integrity.

### 3. **Onboard Display**
- Displays critical real-time metrics, including environmental readings, location, and alerts, directly on the helmet.

### 4. **Camera with Event Buffer**
- Integrated camera records the **previous 20 seconds** of footage upon detecting impacts or falls.
- **MicroSD card support** for secure, local storage of video data.

### 5. **Real-Time Alerts**
- **Piezo buzzer** provides immediate alerts for hazardous gas levels or other critical events.

### 6. **Battery Health Monitoring**
- Continuously tracks battery status to ensure uninterrupted operation and alerts workers to low battery levels.
